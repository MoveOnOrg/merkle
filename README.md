This collection of 3.6 scripts automates download, processing, and import into ActionKit of donation records from a vendor. `process.py` runs the entire process. Each step is in a separate file that can also be run independently. Each script can be run with `--help` to get info on the script and parameters. All parameters can be passed in directly or added to `settings.py`.
